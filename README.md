# Udacity-P1
Project 1: Portfolio Page

This is the GitHub Repository for my Udacity Front-End Web Development Project 1. You can find the HTML
file labeled bootstrap/project1.html, and all related css in bootstrap/css/main.css.  Images used in the HTML can be found in bootstrap/images, as well as placeholder images used in previous iterations.  Kudos to Rachel Ross for formatting tips!

Cheers,

Dave
